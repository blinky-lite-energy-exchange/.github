# The Blinky-Lite Energy Exchange
## A Shock
* Currently, electricity prices have risen dramatically across Europe
* At these rates, people on fixed incomes and small business are at dire financial risk
* Sweden offers spot pricing for electricity
  - Could dramatically reduce costs by shifting usage to off peak hours
  - However, following spot prices requires constant vigilance
    * Monitoring spot price manually is exhausting and error prone
    * To be effective spot pricing monitoring <ins>must be automatic.</ins>
* There are a number of companies offering automated monitoring
  - Most of these services <ins>**require the user to purchase expensive new equipment**</ins> (such as heating systems) that can be connected to the internet.
* Throwing out old systems that are still functioning is <ins>***UNSUSTAINABLE!***</ins>
  - And financially not possible for fixed income families
  - And small businesses

## A Sustainable Open Source Approach
* We have harnessed Blinky-Lite to provide low cost retrofits <ins>to existing equipment</ins> using ***Edge computing***
* We have built a number of devices that easily interface with the scalable Blinky-Lite system that operate with three different modes
  - Manual control
  - Schedule control
  - Spot Price sensitive control

## Blinky Relay
Multi-mode relay to turn on and off low power devices automatically
* Floor pumps
* Radiator pumps
* System on/off control

* Temperature control
* Flow control

## Blinky IR
Multi-mode interface that connects to any device that can be controlled by an infra-red (IR) remote control
* Most heat-pumps have a IR remote control
* We have interfaces for 29 different heat pump models
