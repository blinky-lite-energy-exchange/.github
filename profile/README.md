# The Blinky-Lite Energy Exchange
## A Shock
* Currently, electricity prices have risen dramatically across Europe
* At these rates, people on fixed incomes and small business are at dire financial risk
* Sweden offers spot pricing for electricity
  - Could dramatically reduce costs by shifting usage to off peak hours
  - However, following spot prices requires constant vigilance
    * Monitoring spot price manually is exhausting and error prone
    * To be effective spot pricing monitoring must be automatic.
* There are a number of companies offering automated monitoring
  - Most of these services require the user to purchase expensive new equipment (such as heating systems) that can be connected to the internet.
* Throwing out old systems that are still functioning is UNSUSTAINABLE!
  - And financially not possible for fixed income families
  - And small businesses
